How to use?

The zip file contains 2 macros:

    XMacroWhilePressed: The macro works as long as you hold the X key.

    XMacroTURNONOFF: The X key acts as a toggle to turn the macro on and off.

Macro delay settings

Both macros allow customizable delays. You can enter your preferred delay before the macro starts.
How the macro works:

press and hold 'ı'  
wait 10 ms  
release 'ı'  
wait 10 ms  
press and hold 'o'  
wait 10 ms  
release 'o'

How to perform the Da Hood Speed Glitch:

Open the animations tab where dance packs are located and click on the animation called Greet.
When the animation turns your character to exactly 90 degrees, quickly equip and unequip any item.

For those without animation packs, during the maximum local position of Super Punch, quickly equip and unequip any item.

These actions slightly lower your hitbox to the ground, which activates the glitch. Let's call this super position.

While in super position,
hold down S and X at the same time.

After a few tries, the speed glitch will start working.

    Note: If your keyboard is in English layout, replace the Turkish 'ı' with 'i' in the script.
